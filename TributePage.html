                            <li>Queen Elizabeth II, born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, was born on April 21, 1926, in London,
                                England.
                                She was the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later known as King George VI and Queen
                                Elizabeth
                                (the Queen Mother).</li>

                            <li>Elizabeth's early life was relatively normal for a royal child. She had a loving and supportive
                                family and
                                enjoyed a privileged upbringing. She spent her early years at the family's London residence, 17 Bruton
                                Street, and later at Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.</li>

                            <li>Education played a crucial role in Elizabeth's early life. She received a private education at home,
                                with
                                tutors providing instruction in various subjects such as history, languages, literature, and music.
                                Her
                                parents, especially her mother, Queen Elizabeth, fostered her curiosity and encouraged her to explore
                                different fields of knowledge.</li>

                            <li>In addition to her academic studies, Elizabeth had a keen interest in outdoor activities. She

                            <li>During her early years, Elizabeth's life was influenced by significant events. In 1936, when she was
                                just
                                ten years old, her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated the throne, which led to her father's unexpected
                                ascension as King George VI. This sudden change had a profound impact on Elizabeth's life, as it meant
                                that
                                she would eventually become the heir presumptive to the throne.</li>

                            <li>World War II was another significant event that shaped Elizabeth's early life. Despite the dangers
                                of the
                                bombing raids, she and her sister, Princess Margaret, remained in London to show solidarity with the
                                British
                                people. At the age of 14, Elizabeth made her first public appearance by delivering a radio broadcast
                                to
                                children who were evacuated from the cities and seeking refuge in the countryside.</li>

                            <li>Elizabeth's sense of duty and service to her country became evident during her teenage years. In
                                1945, at
                                the age of 19, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) as a driver and mechanic. This
                                experience
                                allowed her to gain a deeper understanding of the contributions made by women in the war effort and
                                developed her appreciation for the armed forces.</li>

                                <p class="early-life-description">When World War II broke out in 1939, Princess Elizabeth was only 13
                                    years old. As noted by The National World War II Museum, when Buckingham Palace was bombed during the
                                    Blitz in 1940, her father King George VI and his wife, Elizabeth, remained there in solidarity with
                                    the rest of the population, but the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were evacuated to Windsor
                                    Castle, 20 miles away.

                                    In 1945, when she was 18, Elizabeth was given permission to join the
                                    military effort. She joined the Women's Auxiliary Territory Service (ATS), and trained for six weeks
                                    as an auto mechanic. The young princess' dedication to her country and her willingness to serve just
                                    like
                                    anyone else (well, almost; she did get to go home to Windsor Castle every night to sleep) made her
                                    extremely popular and
                                    sparked a lifelong love of cars and mechanical work.

                                <p class="early-life-description">It might not seem like a big deal, but one of Queen Elizabeth's
                                    greatest
                                    achievements was simply being a stable, predictable monarch. Prior to her ascension, there had been a
                                    period of uncertainty.
                                    London was bombed, and according to Britannica, there were real fears that the island might be invaded
                                    by
                                    Germany. Then, just as the country was rebounding from the war, King George VI died at a relatively
                                    young
                                    age, leaving 25-year-old Elizabeth to take the crown.

                                    As noted by Forbes, Elizabeth provided exactly what was necessary in this post-war period: stability.
                                    Her
                                    steady, calm approach to her new role gave the nation exactly what was needed as it emerged from a
                                    particularly chaotic period, and remained exactly what the country needed as a series of new crises
                                    descended on it, including economic woes and a shrinking role on the world stage. With the necessity
                                    of
                                    the royal family always in question, according to The Independent, the stability brought by Elizabeth
                                    can
                                    be seen as crucial.

                                <p class="early-life-description">A rapid list of former colonies began breaking away and declaring
                                    themselves independent states, beginning with India in 1947. Although the process of establishing
                                    what's
                                    known as the Commonwealth began in the late 19th century, according to Britannica, it fell to Queen
                                    Elizabeth II to guide the country through a rapid acceleration of the process. When she was crowned,
                                    the
                                    Commonwealth had eight member states. Today there are 54. That means that Queen Elizabeth oversaw a
                                    process in which practically the entire British Empire transformed into a voluntary association of
                                    sovereign nations. Her own authority became largely ceremonial, and the British "empire" is down to
                                    just a
                                    few islands scattered around the globe. But where other empires have gone down in literal flames,
                                    Elizabeth largely guided hers to a peaceful, orderly end.

                                <p class="early-life-description">The kingdom of England dates back thousands of years, and Elizabeth
                                    was
                                    one in a line of monarchs that dates back to 1066, when William the Conqueror invaded the island. As
                                    noted
                                    in Vanity Fair, when her father, King George VI, took the throne after her uncle's abdication, there
                                    was
                                    no certainty that the monarchy would survive. In the early years of the 20th century, it seemed like

                                    British monarchy would be swept away like so many others. While King George VI provided a period of
                                    stability that forestalled any thought of abolishing the monarchy, Queen Elizabeth was the one who

                                    saved it.

                                <p class="early-life-description">Queen Elizabeth II's greatest achievements came in 1991, more than two
                                    centuries after the U.S. won independence from the British Empire. As reported by the Los Angeles
                                    Times,
                                    that year she became the first British monarch to address a joint session of the United States'
                                    Congress.
                                    As noted by The New York Times, her speech was a huge success — from a joke about her height to the
                                    three
                                    standing ovations she received, she obviously charmed the American politicians.
                                    As noted by the Sun Sentinel, her speech was significant not only because she was the first King or
                                    Queen
                                    of the United Kingdom to address congress, but because she used it to underscore the "special
                                    relationship" between the U.S. and the U.K. The two countries share a language and a great deal of
                                    history
                                    and culture, and the Queen's speech centered on continuing cooperation and a unity of interests.

                                <p class="early-life-description">The royal family is not often cited as being particularly "woke." They
                                    are, after all, privileged as a whole — not just rich but royal. But one of the great and often
                                    overlooked
                                    achievements of the queen was the quiet work she did over the years to support racial equality and
                                    advancement in the world.
                                    Queen Elizabeth's work began in her early years. In 1961, she danced with the president of Ghana,
                                    Kwame
                                    Nkrumah, a Black man. This outraged many racists both in her own kingdom and the larger Commonwealth,
                                    but
                                    the queen was resolute in her support of equality. And she worked behind the scenes to get the
                                    Commonwealth to condemn South Africa's apartheid system, only to be stymied by her own prime minister,
                                    Margaret Thatcher, who opposed the statement for reasons both personal and political.

                                <h4 class="text-center">HER TIRELESS CHARITY WORK</h4>
                                <p class="early-life-description">One of Queen Elizabeth's greatest achievements was a cumulative one:
                                    the
                                    sheer amount of effort she put into supporting various charities. The Guardian puts it very plainly,
                                    arguing that she did more for charity than any other monarch in history.
                                    In fact, Queen Elizabeth was credited with being one of the greatest supporters of charity work in the
                                    world. She supported more than 600 charities in Britain (the royal family as a whole officially
                                    supports
                                    nearly
                                    3,000 charities around the world). The queen was responsible at least in part for raising an
                                    eye-popping
                                    £1.4 billion (close to $2 billion). The queen made it a special focus of her life to help reduce
                                    poverty.
                                    Acting as a royal patron to charities helps focus public attention, and allows the monarch and her
                                    family
                                    members to host fundraisers. In fact, Queen Elizabeth was careful to pass her patronage on to other
                                    family
                                    members to ensure that these charities always have the backing of the monarchy.
